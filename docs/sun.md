# SUN.js

Sun.js is a kind of js-sdk and services for  Tron Network and Sun Network. We encapsulated two objects (mainchain and sidechain). The methods and attributes in mainchain or sidechain can be used to connect with TRON. For example, users can use sun.mainchain.trx.getBalance() to get balance from the mainchain. Futhermore, we add some new methods which are as follows in Sun class so that users can use them to contact between the main chain and the side chain.
